# Implementation Plan for MBBUT

1. ✅ Set up project structure
2. ✅ Implement interactive CLI interface with cliclack
3. ✅ Build TOML config parser for blacklist
4. ✅ Create file walking system with walkdir
5. ✅ Implement hashing with blake3
6. ✅ Add compression with zstd
7. ✅ Integrate parallel processing with rayon
8. ✅ Build resumability system
9. ✅ Enhance resume functionality with dedicated clap command

## Implementation Complete

All features have been implemented according to the project goals:

- Interactive CLI interface using cliclack
- TOML-based blacklist configuration for directories and file extensions
- File compression using zstd
- File hashing with blake3 for resumability
- Parallel processing with rayon
- Command-line interface with clap

The program can be run with:
```
cargo run -- setup   # For first-time setup
cargo run -- run     # To run a backup
cargo run -- resume  # To resume an interrupted backup
```

Or interactively:
```
cargo run
```

## Resume Command Implementation Plan

### Understanding Current State
- The tool currently supports backup operations that compress files and track them with hash registry
- Existing commands: Run and Setup
- Basic resumability exists but no dedicated command for it

### Feature Requirements
1. Add a new "Resume" subcommand to the clap Commands enum
2. Modify the BackupJob to handle resume operations explicitly
3. Update the main.rs to handle the new Resume command
4. Add interactive option for resume in the main menu

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Modify Command Enum
- Add a "Resume" command to the Commands enum in main.rs
- Include similar options to Run (config file path)
- Add appropriate documentation

#### 2. Enhance BackupJob Implementation
- Add a method specifically for resuming transfers
- Reuse existing hash registry to identify files that still need processing
- Update progress reporting to show "resuming" status

#### 3. Update Main Function
- Add a match arm for the Resume command
- Load configuration and hash registry similar to Run
- Call the appropriate BackupJob method for resuming
- Add "resume" as an option to the interactive menu

#### 4. Testing
- Verify that partially completed backups can be resumed
- Ensure only unprocessed files are transferred
- Confirm that the hash registry is properly updated

### Technical Details
- Use the existing HashRegistry to identify which files have already been processed
- Leverage the same file traversal logic but with explicit messaging about resuming
- Maintain the same parallel processing capabilities
- Add appropriate user feedback about the resume operation
