# Implementation Plan for MBBUT

1. ✅ Set up project structure
2. ✅ Implement interactive CLI interface with cliclack
3. ✅ Build TOML config parser for blacklist
4. ✅ Create file walking system with walkdir
5. ✅ Implement hashing with blake3
6. ✅ Add compression with zstd
7. ✅ Integrate parallel processing with rayon
8. ✅ Build resumability system

## Implementation Complete

All features have been implemented according to the project goals:

- Interactive CLI interface using cliclack
- TOML-based blacklist configuration for directories and file extensions
- File compression using zstd
- File hashing with blake3 for resumability
- Parallel processing with rayon
- Command-line interface with clap

The program can be run with:
```
cargo run -- setup  # For first-time setup
cargo run -- run    # To run a backup
```

Or interactively:
```
cargo run
```
